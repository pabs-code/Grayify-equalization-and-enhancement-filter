## About the Project

This app is a simple yet powerful demonstration of image processing using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Pillow**.

It provides an intuitive interface to:
- Upload images
- Convert them to grayscale
- Visualize histograms of pixel intensities
- Apply basic filters like contrast enhancement or histogram equalization

## Features

| Feature              | Description                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Image Upload         | Supports JPG, JPEG, and PNG formats.                                               |
| Grayscale Conversion | Converts uploaded image to grayscale using Pillow's `ImageOps.grayscale()` method. |
| Histogram Generation | Displays a histogram of pixel intensities using Matplotlib.                        |
| Image Filters        | Includes options for **contrast enhancement** or **histogram equalization**.       |

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and set up your environment to run the app.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit (`pip install streamlit`)
- Pillow (`pip install pillow`)
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)
- Numpy (`pip install numpy`)

You can install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install streamlit pillow matplotlib numpy
```

or run the provided ```requirements.txt``` file.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository (or download it as a ZIP):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd image-to-grayscale-converter
   ```

---

## Running Script

To run the app, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will start a local development server and open the Streamlit app in your browser.

---

## Expectations When Running This App

- Upload an image file (JPG, JPEG, or PNG).
- The original image is displayed alongside its grayscale version.
- A histogram of pixel intensities is shown for the grayscale image.
- You can apply filters like **enhance** or **equalize** to further process the image.

---

## Demo

Here's a quick overview of how the app works:

1. Upload an image using the file uploader.
2. The original and grayscale versions are displayed side-by-side.
3. A histogram is shown for pixel intensity distribution.
4. Select a filter (Enhance or Equalize) to modify the image further.

> ðŸ“Œ *Note: This is not a video, but you can imagine how it works by running the app locally.*
